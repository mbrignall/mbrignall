* Hi, I’m @mbrignall

*Security Engineer* (blue team); casting automations and protecting the org. 

** Exploring:

:telescope: NixOS | IaC/Terraform | C | Emacs

** Me in 3:

:seedling: Curious, inquisitive, pragmatic.

** Feel goods:

:zap: EDM/IDM | Punk/HxC (+subgenres of) | The fingerstyle guitar of John Fahey

I'm somewhere between an obsessive discoverer of the strange and unusual (music or emphemera) and a wannabe computer science student. I prefer e-waste to brand new devices and things.
